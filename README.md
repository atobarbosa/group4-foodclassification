Food Classification System (MindSpore + ResNet50)
Project Overview

This project implements a Food Image Classification System using MindSpore and a pretrained ResNet50 model from MindCV.
The system allows users to upload food images, which are preprocessed and classified into predefined food categories. Results are displayed via a simple client interface, while the server handles inference and logging.

Objectives

Provide a working demo of deep learning–based image classification using MindSpore.

Fine-tune and deploy a ResNet50 model for food image recognition.

Build a client–server setup (FastAPI + Flet) to demonstrate real-time classification.

Deliver a simple but significant example of applied AI for everyday use.

System Features

Upload food images (JPG, PNG).

Preprocessing and real-time classification with ResNet50.

View recent prediction history.

Admin features: manage food classes and view system logs.
